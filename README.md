## Dependency Policy

- All `@nestjs/*` packages use the same major version.
- Use pinned or caret (`^`) versions for stability, but avoid `*` except where absolutely necessary (replace `"@nestjs/mapped-types": "*"` as soon as possible).
- Update dependencies regularly and review for security issues.
- Prefer semantic versioning, test thoroughly after major upgrades.
- Lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) must be committed and kept up to date.
